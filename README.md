This is a home made application developed in Python3 to read DICOM files.

This "README" is empty, if you want to see the user guide, please go and read ['Gu√≠aDeUsuario.pdf'](https://github.com/MauricioZapata00/DicomReading/blob/main/GuiaDeUsuario.pdf). Yes, I know that it is in spanish. Sorry :'(
